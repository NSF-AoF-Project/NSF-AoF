    abstract = "In educational applications, knowledge tracing refers to the problem of estimating students{'} time-varying concept/skill mastery level from their past responses to questions and predicting their future performance.One key limitation of most existing knowledge tracing methods is that they treat student responses to questions as binary-valued, i.e., whether they are correct or incorrect. Response correctness analysis/prediction is straightforward, but it ignores important information regarding mastery, especially for open-ended questions.In contrast, exact student responses can provide much more information.In this paper, we conduct the first exploration int open-ended knowledge tracing (OKT) by studying the new task of predicting students{'} exact open-ended responses to questions.Our work is grounded in the domain of computer science education with programming questions. We develop an initial solution to the OKT problem, a student knowledge-guided code generation approach, that combines program synthesis methods using language models with student knowledge tracing methods. We also conduct a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments on a real-world student code dataset to validate and demonstrate the promise of OKT.",

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) often incorporate lecture-based learning along with lecture notes, textbooks, and videos to students. Moreover, MOOCs also incorporate practice activities and quizzes. Student learning in MOOCs can be tracked and improved using state-of-the-art student modeling. Currently, this means employing conventional student models that are constructed around Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Traditional ITS systems only utilize students performance interactions (quiz, problem-solving or practice activities). Therefore, text interactions are entirely ignored while modeling students performance in MOOCs using these cognitive models. In this work, we propose a Comprehension Factor Analysis model (CFM) for online courses, which integrates student reading interactions in student models to track and predict learning outcomes. Our model evaluation shows that CFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting students' performance in a MOOC. These models can help better student-wise adaptation in the context of MOOCs.},

Related research suggests that response time can provide information with respect to correctness. However, time is not consistently used when modeling students' performance. Here, we build on previous work that indicated that the relationship between response time and student performance is non-linear. Based on this concept, we compare three models: a standard Additive Factors Analysis Model (AFM), an AFM model enhanced with a linear step duration parameter and an AFM model enhanced with a quadratic, step duration parameter. The results of this comparison show that the AFM model that is enhanced with the quadratic step duration parameter outperforms the other models over four different datasets and for most of the metrics we used to evaluate the models in cross validation and prediction.},

abstract = {Automated analysis of programming data using code representation methods offers valuable services for programmers, from code completion to clone detection to bug detection. Recent studies show the effectiveness of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), pre-trained Transformer-based models, and graph-based embeddings in programming code representation. However, pre-trained large language models lack interpretability, while other embedding-based approaches struggle with extracting important information from large ASTs. This study proposes a novel Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN) to address these gaps by integrating different components: an optimized sequential subtree extraction process using Genetic algorithm optimization, a two-way embedding approach, and an attention network. We investigate the effectiveness of SANN by applying it to two different tasks: program correctness prediction and algorithm detection on two educational datasets containing both small and large-scale code snippets written in Java and C, respectively. The experimental results show SANN's competitive performance against baseline models from the literature, including code2vec, ASTNN, TBCNN, CodeBERT, GPT-2, and MVG, regarding accurate predictive power. Finally, a case study is presented to show the interpretability of our model prediction and its application for an important human-centered computing application, student modeling. Our results indicate the effectiveness of the SANN model in capturing important syntactic and semantic information from students' code, allowing the construction of accurate student models, which serve as the foundation for generating adaptive instructional support such as individualized hints and feedback.},

abstract = {The emergence of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT poses unprecedented risks of new types of plagiarism and cheating where students use LLMs to solve exercises for them. Detecting this behavior will be a necessary component in introductory computer science (CS1) courses, and educators should be well-equipped with detection tools when the need arises. However, ChatGPT generates code non-deterministically, and thus, traditional similarity detectors might not suffice to detect AI-created code. In this work, we explore the affordances of Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection task. We used an openly available dataset of student programs for CS1 assignments and had ChatGPT generate code for the same assignments, and then evaluated the performance of both traditional machine learning models and Abstract Syntax Tree-based (AST-based) deep learning models in detecting ChatGPT code from student code submissions. Our results suggest that both traditional machine learning models and AST-based deep learning models are effective in identifying ChatGPT-generated code with accuracy above 90\%. Since the deployment of such models requires ML knowledge and resources that are not always accessible to instructors, we also explore the patterns detected by deep learning models that indicate possible ChatGPT code signatures, which instructors could possibly use to detect LLM-based cheating manually. We also explore whether explicitly asking ChatGPT to impersonate a novice programmer affects the code produced. We further discuss the potential applications of our proposed models for enhancing introductory computer science instruction.},
